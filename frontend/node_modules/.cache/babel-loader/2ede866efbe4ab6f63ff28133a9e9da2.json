As I said, I had been on a\n              long spiritual journey. I had looked at eastern religions, New Age\n              teachings, and all that was weird and wonderful to me. But in an\n              instant my spiritual direction changed forever, and I have never\n              looked back.{\" \"}\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"aboutMeStoryThird\">\n              <strong className=\"underLine\">May 2020</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"aboutMeStoryThird\">\n              We were in the Covid-19 pandemic and in and out of lockdown. This\n              was when my youngest daughter collapsed and was rushed into\n              intensive care, put in an induced coma and on the ventilator. She\n              had been living with a serious eating disorder for some time. It\n              was a very stressful and heart-breaking time. I was told for two\n              weeks that she wouldn’t pull through. However, after three months\n              in hospital and despite the odds against her, and with Covid-19\n              around, she miraculously survived.{\" \"}\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"joProfile\"></div>\n        <div className=\"backgroundFourth\">\n          <div className=\"sectionFour\">\n            <p className=\"aboutMeStoryFour\">\n              <span className=\"dateStyle\">July 2020 </span>– Life had become\n              somewhat slower since my heart attack. At this time of heightened\n              stress and lockdowns, a new period of creativity began with my\n              painting a bottle.
