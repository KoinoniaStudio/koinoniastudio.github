Wood piles were re-located. An area was\n          cleared. People with building skills and other skills turned up to\n          help to make the most amazing studio. I couldn’t believe my eyes.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"aboutMeStory\">\n          June 2021 to August 2021 – My daughter number 2 was rushed into\n          hospital with double pneumonia, sepsis, and necrosis. She was in a\n          coma for 5 weeks. For three weeks I was told that she would not pull\n          through. However, because of the prayers of many, her miraculous\n          recovery began, and she was taken off the ventilator. She had a\n          tracheotomy, but in one week she was breathing for herself. Two weeks\n          later, and to the utter amazement of the medics, she was eating,\n          talking and in her own strength walked out of the hospital.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"aboutMeStory\">\n          In August when my daughter was still in hospital, I needed to have\n          another heart procedure. We were able to meet up for coffee and we\n          were discharged within days of each another.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"aboutMeStory\">\n          I looked back on the previous 14 months which had been incredibly\n          scary, heart-breaking, glorious and joyful. Through all this my art\n          studio provided a haven and a place for deep therapy. It gave me my\n          sanity and creativity. My ideas and artwork developed.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"aboutMeStory\">\n          December 2021 – I was continuing with my art. I was enjoying my gift\n          of a studio, which was beyond my dreams. The studio not only helped my\n          creativity, it also helped me to avoid falling into the pit of worry\n          and despair. Ideas started forming. I wanted to give back out of the\n          riches I felt I had received.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"aboutMeStory\">\n          For 10 years I had walked a painful journey with my youngest daughter\n          who had a serious eating disorder. In supporting her I discovered how\n          little awareness there was about eating disorders and the challenges\n          faced in providing for the needs of sufferers, not only in Swansea but\n          also in Wales as a whole. I wanted to help in some way with any monies\n          I could raise from my art.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"aboutMeStory\">\n          My personal vision is to have better provision for people with eating\n          disorders – to have a building in Swansea with consultation rooms,\n          therapy rooms, art room, chill out room and kitchen. I know this is a\n          big dream which needs big money and big hearts. The idea of “Have a\n          Heart” was born. I contacted people in the NHS and at various levels\n          in government to tell them.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"aboutMeStory\">\n          January 2022 – The result of my dream began. My art creations were\n          photographed and KOINONIA STUDIO was registered as a social business.\n          It is really a “profit for purpose” company.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"aboutMeStory\">\n          February 2022 – I was guided in the direction of VETERANS ENTERPRISE\n          UK and the BRITISH TRAINING BOARD who offered enormous support and\n          help to hold an exhibition of my art. I am most grateful and beginning\n          to live the dream. Nothing is impossible with God.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"aboutMeStory\">\n          The journey continues … Thank you for taking the time to read “My\n          Journey”.
