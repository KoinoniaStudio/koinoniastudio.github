              I was born in the Netherlands in the <strong>1950s</strong> and
              have lived in many places. I currently live in the UK and have
              done so for many years. I could write a book on these times, some
              joyful but very often turbulent.

              I now live in a beautiful cosy cottage – with squirrels and many
              species of birds in my idyllic garden. It is a rural setting at
              the edge of the small village of Pontlliw, on the outskirts of
              Swansea. I have four children, now adults, one boy and three
              girls, also two mice-catching cats.

              One day this month, without realising what was happening, I found

              was when my youngest daughter collapsed and was rushed into

              had been living with a serious eating disorder for some time. It
